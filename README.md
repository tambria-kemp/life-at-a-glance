Summary:
This app is a simple dashboard that pulls in finance and weather data that I look at on a day to do basis.  It puts everything all in one place instead of looking at multiple apps to get this set of data. You also have the ability to search stock prices and related news to that stock ticker.  It shows the weather condition and temperature based on your location.
